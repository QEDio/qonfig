Qonfig
=======================================

Qonfig abstracts configuration data from its represenation in the Database. "Traditionally" this would be implemented 
with ActiveRecord (or another database mapper) but with qonfig as a layer in between this is becoming completly transparent.

Currently the "database" is a ruby-file. The Interface to get the data from a 
* flat file
* database or
* via an API

has still to be written.
